## OOPS PROJECT

This is a Record Management System to manage the data of Pokemon Trainers appearing for the Pokemon League. Has all the basic operations like Create, Read, Update and Delete users (plus some extra features like sort, multi-field search, etc.) One of our members knew how to use Java Swing so we decided to make a GUI app after taking the permission of Dr. Shathana. The logic behind all the operations remains similar. We hope you like it UwU


## Instructions for Using the App

Whole code is written in `src` folder.

- `db`: this contains code that interacts with the database.

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

- fork the repo and navigate to folder `src`.
- Add mysql driver `mysql-connector-java-8.0.16.jar` to `lib` folder.

## Pokedex

This is a Record Management System to manage the data of Pokemon Trainers. Has all the basic operations like Create, Read, Update and Delete users (plus some extra features like sort, multi-field search, etc.) .The logic behind all the operations remains similar. I hope you like it UwU


## Instructions for Using the App
- Open your MySQL database and make a database with name and give appropriate url in app
- for example if you have a database called `pokedex` then you can use `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/pokedex`

Whole code is written in `src` folder.

- `db`: this contains code that interacts with the database.

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

- fork the repo and navigate to folder `src`.
- Add mysql driver `mysql-connector-java-8.0.16.jar` to `lib` folder.
